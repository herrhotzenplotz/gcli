.Sh CAVEATS
GitHub and Gitea treat Pull Requests as Issues. Due to the semantics
of
.Nm
those issues that are actually PRs are dropped from the output. In
this case a note will be printed indicating how many issues were
dropped. You can suppress this warning using the
.Fl q
program option.
.Sh BUGS
GitHub only supports removing labels from issues one by one. If you
still want to remove multiple issues with a single gcli call, you may
do something like:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ gcli issues -i42 \\
        labels remove bug \\
        labels remove foo
.Ed

Alternatively you can report them on any of the forges linked at
.Lk @PACKAGE_URL@ .
However, the preferred and quickest method is to use the mailing
list.
