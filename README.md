# GCLI

Simple and portable CLI tool for interacting with GitHub, GitLab and
Gitea from the command line.

![](docs/screenshot-04.png)

## Why?

The official GitHub CLI tool only supports GitHub. I wanted a simple
unified tool for various git forges such as GitHub and GitLab because
every forge does things differently yet all build on Git and
purposefully break with its philosophy.

Also, the official tool from Github is written in Go, which does
manual [DNS
resolution](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/dnsclient_unix.go#L49)
which is a massive security vulnerability for people using Tor as it
leaks your IP to the DNS server. This program builds upon libcurl,
which obeys the operating system's DNS resolution mechanisms and thus
also works with Tor.

## Building

### Download

Recent tarballs can be downloaded here:

[https://herrhotzenplotz.de/gcli/releases/](https://herrhotzenplotz.de/gcli/releases/)

Please note that the tarballs provided by Github and Gitlab will not
work without you having autoconf and automake installed. So please
consider using the link above.

There are official packages available:

- [FreeBSD](https://freshports.org/devel/gcli)

### Dependencies

Required dependencies:
- libcurl
- yacc (System V yacc, Berkeley Yacc or Bison should suffice)
- lex (flex is preferred)
- C99 Compiler and linker
- make

Optional dependencies:
- pkg-config

If you are building from Git you will also need:
- m4
- autoconf
- automake

The test suite requires:
- [Kyua](https://github.com/jmmv/kyua)
- [ATF](https://github.com/jmmv/atf)

### Compile
In order to perform a build, do:
```console
$ ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
$ make
# make [DESTDIR=/] install
```

You may leave out `DESTDIR` and `--prefix=`. The above is the default
value. The final installation destination is `$DESTDIR/$PREFIX/...`.

If you are unsure, consult the builtin configure help by running
`./configure --help`.

Also, if you are building from Git you need to generate the configure script
first:
```console
$ ./autogen.sh
```

For more details also see [HACKING.md](HACKING.md).

In case any of this does not work, please either report a bug, or
submit a patch in case you managed to fix it.
