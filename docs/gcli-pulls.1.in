.Sh DESCRIPTION
Use
.Nm
to list, create, edit or delete Pull Requests (PRs) in repositories on
various
.Xr git 1
forges such as GitLab, Gitea or GitHub. Without any action specified,
.Nm
will list open PRs in the given or autodetected repository.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s , -sorted
Reverse the output such that most recent items appear at the bottom.
.It Fl o , -owner Ar owner
List PRs in the repository of the given owner. This option can only
be used in combination with
.Fl r .
.It Fl r , -repo Ar repo
List PRs in the given repository. This option can only be used in
combination with
.Fl o .
.It Fl A , -author Ar author
Filter pull requests by the given author.
.Pp
Note that the implementation is somewhat limited on GitHub and Gitea
since the respective API does not allow off-loading the filtering to
its side. Due to this fact using this option may take an increased
amount of time because
.Nm
needs to iterate all the fetched data and filter out the requested
information.
.It Fl L , -label Ar label
Filter pull requests by the given label. See the notes about the
.Fl A
option above - the same reasoning applies to this option.
.It Fl M , -milestone Ar milestone
Filter pull requests by the given milestone. See the notes about the
.Fl A
option above - the same reasoning applies to this option.
.It Fl a
List all PRs, including closed and merged ones. Cannot be combined
with actions. This does not affect the
.Fl n
option.
.It Fl n , -count Ar n
Fetch at least
.Ar n
pull requests. Default: 30. If
.Ar n
is set to -1 this will fetch all pull requests. Note that on large
repositories fetching all pull requests can take a considerable amount
of time and may result in rate limiting by the respective API.

on the specified
