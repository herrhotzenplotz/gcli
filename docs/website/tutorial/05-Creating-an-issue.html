<h1>Creating an issue</h1>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This assumes you have <a href="./04-Account-Setup.html">configured gcli with an account</a> for Github already.</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>For this case I have a playground repository that you may as well use
for testing with gcli. It is available at
<code>herrhotzenplotz/ghcli-playground</code>.</p>
<p>To see a list of issues, we can run:</p>
<pre><code>$ gcli -t github issues -o herrhotzenplotz -r ghcli-playground -a
NUMBER  NOTES  STATE   TITLE
    13      0  open    yet another issue
    12      0  closed  wat
    11      0  closed  blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
    10      0  closed  &quot;this is the quoted&quot; issue title? anyone?&quot;
     9      0  closed  test
     8      0  closed  foobar
     7      0  closed  foobar
     5      0  closed  test2
     4      0  closed  test
$
</code></pre>
<h2>Invoke gcli</h2>
<p>Let's create a bug report where we complain about things not working:</p>
<pre><code>$ gcli -t github issues create -o herrhotzenplotz -r ghcli-playground \
    &quot;Bug: Doesn't work on my machine&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The message &quot;Bug: doesn't work on my machine&quot; is the title of the
issue.</p>
<h2>Original Post</h2>
<p>You will see the default editor come up and instruct you to type in a
message. This message is the &quot;original post&quot; or the body of the issue
ticket that you're about to submit. You can use Markdown Syntax:</p>
<pre><code> I tried building this code on my machine but unfortunately it errors
 out with the following message:

 ```console
 $ make love
 make: don't know how to make love. Stop

 make: stopped in /tmp/wat
 $
 ```

 What am I doing wrong?

 ! ISSUE TITLE : Bug: Doesn't work on my machine
 ! Enter issue description above.
 ! All lines starting with '!' will be discarded.
</code></pre>
<h2>Submit the issue</h2>
<p>After you save and exit the editor gcli gives you a chance to check
back and finally submit the issue. Type 'y' and hit enter.</p>
<p>You can check back if the issue was created and also view details
about it as you learned earlier.</p>
